## About The Project

I created a program that uses an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) called Long short-term memory (LSTM), which is an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections.

Here's why:
The stock market can be unpredictable but machine learning is one of the best ways to help do quantitative analysis.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.

## Built With

Skylearn, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Python Programming.

## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples, and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.
