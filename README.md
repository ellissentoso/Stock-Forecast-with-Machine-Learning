## About The Project

I created a program that uses an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) called Long short-term memory (LSTM), which is an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections.

Here's why:
The stock market can be unpredictable but machine learning is one of the best ways to help do quantitative analysis.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.

## Built With

Jupyter Notebook and Python Programming.
Libraries: math, pandas_datareader, numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib.
